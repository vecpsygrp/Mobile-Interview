# Calculator App Assessment (45 minutes)

## Overview
In this assessment, you will complete a simple calculator application using React and TypeScript. The project skeleton has been set up for you, and your task is to implement the core calculator functionality.

## Tasks

1. **Review the Code Structure**
   - Familiarize yourself with the project structure and components
   - Understand the existing components: Calculator, Display, and Button

2. **Implement Calculator Logic**
   - Complete the `Calculator.tsx` component to handle arithmetic operations
   - Implement proper state management for calculator operations
   - Ensure proper handling of numbers, operators, and the equals button
   
3. **Handle Edge Cases**
   - Prevent division by zero
   - Handle decimal point input correctly
   - Manage number display limitations
   
4. **Improve Type Safety**
   - Use TypeScript interfaces and types appropriately
   - Ensure all components have proper type definitions

5. **Polish and Test**
   - Test your calculator for correctness
   - Ensure the UI behaves as expected

## Requirements

Your calculator should support the following operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Clear (C)
- Decimal point (.)
- Equals (=)

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: Does your calculator work correctly for all operations?
- **TypeScript Usage**: Are you using types and interfaces appropriately?
- **Code Organization**: Is your code well-structured and easy to follow?
- **Error Handling**: Are edge cases handled appropriately?
- **UI/UX**: Does your calculator feel responsive?

Good luck!
